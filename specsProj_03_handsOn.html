    <h3>Hands-On Project 1</h3>
    <p>Based on the following usage of the TodoList component, write the component using the class syntax. Your component should have proptypes for all of its props.<br>
        <a href='http://localhost:3003/' target='_blank'>Solution</a></p>

    <xmp>
TodoList title="Student todo" items={['Sign up for code review', 'Finish TodoList component', 'Get lots of sleep']}
    </xmp>
<h3>Hands-On Project 2 (Optional)</h3>
<p>Extend your implementation of the TodoList to support the additional props</p>
<xmp>
numberToShow - this limits how many items are shown in the list order - this has 3 possible values, default, ascending, descending and either leaves the items in order (default) or sorts the list items (ascending, descending).</p>
</xmp>
<h3>Hands-On Project 3 (Optional)</h3>
<p>Create a new component List that takes the list renderer as a prop and displays the list contents wrapped in a div with a border and background color. Demonstrate using this List component and using TodoList as the list renderer prop, then create a new kind of list component that you can use in place of TodoList and demonstrate using that component with List.</p>
