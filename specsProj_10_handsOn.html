        Let's finish the Github project we were working on throughout the second half of the course.</p>

        <p>Currently we are making a request on the search page, but we are not displaying it. Practice your React skills by incorporating those query results into the view.</p>

        <p>We also have a page for our repositories but there is nothing on it. Build up that page to make a request to Github that pulls your repos and then display them on the page.</p>

        <p>Complete these two tasks using a combination of React and Redux.</p>
